# TripTime
nofar taub & liron taub

This project is our final project in which we created an application that aims to encourage people to go out and travel in Israel despite the difficulties involved in doing so, such as lack of knowledge about the location and more.


## The app offers:


- Knowledge about the place itself, for example, whether there are toilets and showers, whether it is possible to light a fire, etc.
- Unknown places where you can travel.
- Option to upload photos.
- Option to give a response to a place on the map.
and more
